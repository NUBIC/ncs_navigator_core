# The definition of a household is really based on the individual person's definition of a family.
# The common definition is residence at the same address; however, the composition of the household might be 
# parent/child; siblings; roommates, or other combinations of relationships. 
#
# Household may move from one dwelling unit to another, or families that comprise a single household may split 
# into two households with different addresses. If a family moves from the DU to a non-sampled address they wonâ€™t 
# get a new DU-ID but we would still collect their address information as an HH. So a household can be linked to 
# several dwelling units In some cases only one link is active at a time. In other cases there are Households living 
# in multiple dwelling units simultaneously. Thus, there is a many to many relationship between DU and HH that must 
# be defined in this table. The link that defines each DU-HH relationship contains status information about the 
# relationship. The links, however, are distinguishable by other information maintained on the linking record.
#
# A new record here is created when a household is identified as associated with an address. 
# It may be "updated during conversations with participants, from secondary data sources, or from other types of contacts."
