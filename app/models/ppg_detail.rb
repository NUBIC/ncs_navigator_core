# Basic non-repeating Pregnancy Probability Group (PPG) status information 
# is stored here for each woman who completes a pregnancy screener. 
# Eligibility criteria for administration of the pregnancy screener are based on 4 elements: 
# * gender (i.e., female); 
# * primary residence (i.e., participant lives in a sampled Dwelling Unit); 
# * age (i.e., 18-49); 
# * currently known as pregnant â€“ regardless of age. 
# 
# In the event that a mother has several pregnancies, each pregnancy would have its own 
# PPG Details record. 
# There is a one-to-many relationship between Participant and PPG Details.
