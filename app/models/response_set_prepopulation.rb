##
# Although responses in surveys are generally provided by study participants,
# there are a few reasons for Cases to provide responses before a participant
# (or, in the case of Field, a field worker) sees the response:
#
# 1. In multi-part instruments, responses in subsequent parts may replicate
#    previously collected data.  It is convenient to prepopulate those
#    responses with the previously collected responses.
# 2. Default values for some responses can be derived from operational data.
# 3. Handlebars helpers in survey text derive their values from response data.
#
# This module is the public interface to the prepopulation code.
