Auditing guidelines
-------------------

When investigating a line, consider not only its immediate actions but also its
context.  Not all uses of Date.today/#first/etc are incorrect.

If you did not write the code under investigation and cannot easily determine
if it is incorrect, use git blame to find out who wrote it and ask that
developer about their assumptions.  For code written by developers that are
no longer present, assume that it's incorrect and proceed to the next steps.

For code that is incorrect or looks incorrect, write examples that demonstrate
violation of incorrect order assumptions.

For code that looks correct, prove that the code functions properly even under
Date.today/#first/etc edge cases.  Write examples that demonstrate proper
functioning in the presence of edge cases.  Even if the code is correct,
investigate how to refactor it so that it does not need to depend on suspect
patterns.

When you complete an audit, tag the corresponding line with @fixed:commit-ish,
and commit the changes.
