Auditing guidelines
-------------------

When investigating a line, consider not only its immediate actions but also its
context.  Not all uses of Date.today/#first/etc are incorrect.

If you did not write the code under investigation and cannot easily determine
if it is incorrect, use git blame to find out who wrote it and ask that
developer about their assumptions.

In either case, you may need to augment Cases' spec suite with examples that
demonstrate correct functionality.  You should also investigate whether
Date.today/#first/etc need to stay around; in many cases, the suspect patterns
can be factored out.

When you complete an audit, tag the corresponding line with @fixed:commit-ish,
and commit the changes.

# vim:ts=2:sw=2:et:tw=78
