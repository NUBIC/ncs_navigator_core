NCS MDES Records

Every NCS record has a life cycle, when it is created and under which circumstances it can be edited. 


Setting up Study Center information (Operational)
-----------------------------------

The following tables need to be set up once for each Study Center using NCS Navigator. Once set these records will NOT be edited (unless incorrect for some reason).

Study Center (SC)
Primary Sampling Unit   (PSU)
Secondary Sampling Unit (SSU)
Tertiary Sampling Unit  (TSU)

(SSU and TSU are only used in the Hi/Lo studies - as the study continues other SSU/TSU records might be identified)

Dwelling Unit (Operational)
-------------

Dwelling Units are an identified address. Once identified the data in this record will rarely change. 

  Possible reasons for change or use:
  * Dwelling disappears
  * New association with household
  

Dwelling Household Linking
--------------------------

A new record here is created when a household is identified as associated with an address. It may be "updated during conversations with participants, from secondary data sources, or from other types of contacts."


Household
---------

A household record is created when it is determined that a household is eligible for the NCS and also records the reason it is eligible. "Household information becomes known during the Enumeration or the Pregnancy Screening process.  The Household table should be completed at that time."

Once a household is identified it continues to be associated with the participant(s) and people related to them.
